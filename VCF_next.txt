#What is next:
#Fit it into my HPC script.
	Pseudocode Idea: If grep results come back THEN execute the script. Else, continue
#Potential issue
	Multiple multiallelic sites. This script doesnt loop through so im not sure what would happen.
	
	Good news: I have a script that rips apart the SLiM output files into individual VCF files, so I can just run VCF_Combine_Multiallelic_Sites.sh on these instead of the appeneded files that SLiM creates.

#Good news
	It runs fast, instantly as far as I can tell.
